  "why we should not enjoy sense pleasures are per Bhagavad Gita": "The Bhagavad Gita teaches that attachment to sense pleasures is a major source of suffering and is a hindrance to spiritual progress.

They are meant to be enjoyed in moderation, but not to be pursued to the point of addiction or attachment. The idea is that by experiencing the temporary nature of sense pleasures, one can come to understand the nature of the world and the ultimate goal of spiritual freedom.\n\nAnother perspective is that sense pleasures are a tool for the soul to experience the world and learn the lessons it needs to learn to evolve and progress on its spiritual journey. They are a way for the soul to experience the duality of the world and understand the nature of existence.\n\nIt is also important to note that different belief systems and religions have different perspectives on the nature of God and the creation of the universe, so it's important to consider the context in which the question is being asked.\n\nIn any case, the Bhagavad Gita teaches that the ultimate goal is not to indulge in the sense pleasures, but to understand the nature of the world and the ultimate goal of spiritual freedom."

  "why Krishna cheated Duryodhana in the war?": "Lord Krishna, as the supreme Godhead, is believed to have a divine plan and to act according to his own will and wisdom. In the Mahabharata, the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas is seen as a necessary step in the restoration of dharma (righteousness) in the world. Duryodhana, the leader of the Kauravas, was seen as an embodiment of adharma (unrighteousness) due to his greed, arrogance and lack of compassion for his opponents.\n\nThe war between the Pandavas and Kauravas was not just a physical battle but also a spiritual battle between good and evil. Lord Krishna's role as the charioteer of Arjuna, the leader of the Pandavas, was to guide and support Arjuna in his fight against adharma. Lord Krishna's ultimate goal was not to defeat the Kauravas but to restore dharma in the world.\n\nIt is also said that Lord Krishna did not want to fight the war but he was forced to do so, as it was his duty to protect the righteous and to restore justice. He also knew that the Kauravas were so blinded by their own ambition, they would not have heeded any counsel or advice, He also knew that if the war was not fought, the evil would have continued to flourish, leading to more suffering and chaos in the world.\n\nIn summary, Lord Krishna's actions in the war were motivated by his desire to restore dharma and to protect the innocent and the righteous. He is believed to have acted according to his own divine plan, and his actions were ultimately for the greater good."
